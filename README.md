# Leyu API

Leyu API is a NestJS backend for managing crowdsourced data collection, annotation, review, task distribution, contributor payments, notifications, and operational reporting.

The system is designed around projects, tasks, micro-tasks, contributors, reviewers, facilitators, project managers, and administrators. It includes the infrastructure needed to run the platform locally or in containers: PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, BullMQ, MinIO/S3-compatible storage, email, SMS, push notifications, and Santim Pay integration.

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   On Windows PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   Copy-Item .env.example .env
   ```

4. Update `.env` for your local services.

   Required configuration includes:

   ```env
   PORT=3000
   NODE_ENV=development

   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your_jwt_refresh_secret

5. Run migrations and seeds.

   ```bash
   npm run migration:run
   npm run seed
   ```

## Development

Run the API in watch mode:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

Run in debug mode:

```bash
npm run start:debug
```

Run the compiled production build:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start:prod
```

The API uses the global prefix `/api`.

- API base URL: `http://localhost:3000/api`
- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:3000/doc`
- Health check: `http://localhost:3000/api/health`
- Bull Board: `http://localhost:3000/admin/queues`

## Docker

Docker Compose starts:

- `postgres`
- `redis`
- `rabbitmq`
- `minio`
- `minio-init`
- `app`

Start the full stack:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

View logs:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

Stop services:

```bash
docker compose down
```

Remove containers and volumes:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

RabbitMQ management UI is available at `http://localhost:15672` with the default local credentials `guest / guest`.

MinIO is available to containers at `http://minio:9000`. For local host access, the API and console bind to `127.0.0.1:9000` and `127.0.0.1:9001` by default. The `minio-init` job creates the configured bucket and app-scoped storage user before the API starts.

See [RUN_BACKEND.md](RUN_BACKEND.md) for the detailed Docker runbook.

## Database and Seeds

```bash
# Generate a migration from entity changes
npm run migration:generate

# Create an empty migration
npm run migration:create

# Run migrations
npm run migration:run

# Show migration state
npm run migration:show

# Revert the latest migration
npm run migration:revert

# Run seeds
npm run seed

# Create a seed
npm run seed:create
```

Seed files currently include initial roles, countries, regions, and rejection types.

## Testing and Code Quality

```bash
# Unit tests
npm run test

# Unit tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Test coverage
npm run test:cov

# End-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e

# Lint and auto-fix
npm run lint

# Format source and tests
npm run format
```

## Operational Notes

- `NODE_ENV=production` cannot use `CORS_ORIGIN=*`; configure a concrete origin or comma-separated origin list.
- Docker Compose defines MinIO and an idempotent `minio-init` job for local object storage.
- The app validates required environment variables during startup with Joi.
- The app sanitizes database, Redis, and RabbitMQ credentials in startup logs.
- Production Docker startup runs compiled migrations before starting the API.

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues

- Confirm PostgreSQL is running.
- Confirm `DATABASE_URL` points to the right host and port.
- For Docker Compose, use `postgres` as the host inside `.env`; for host-machine local development against the Compose database, use `localhost:5433`.

### Redis Connection Issues

- Confirm Redis is running.
- Confirm `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`, and `REDIS_URL`.
- For Docker Compose, use `redis` as the host inside containers.

### RabbitMQ Connection Issues

- Confirm RabbitMQ is running.
- Confirm `RABBITMQ_URI`.
- For Docker Compose, use `rabbitmq` as the host inside containers.
- RabbitMQ management is available at `http://localhost:15672`.

### File Upload Issues

- Confirm `MINIO_ENDPOINT`, access key, secret key, and bucket.
- Confirm the bucket exists and the app can reach the object storage service.
- Confirm Redis is available because upload processing uses BullMQ.

### SMS, Email, or Notification Issues

- Confirm provider credentials and sender settings.
- Check provider rate limits.
- Check RabbitMQ configuration for notification publishing.
- Check logs for failed delivery attempts.
