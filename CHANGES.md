## Modifications

All changes made in this fork relative to the upstream `mahder-backend` are
tracked in the Git history of this repository. The list below summarizes the
notable categories of modification; consult `git log` for the authoritative
record.

### Bootstrap, error handling, and configuration safety

- Removed a duplicate `ProjectModule` registration from `AppModule`.
- Registered `AllExceptionsFilter` globally and added consistent formatting for
  array-style validation errors.
- Sanitized credential-bearing URLs (Database, Redis, RabbitMQ) in startup logs.
- Blocked wildcard `CORS_ORIGIN` in production and tightened CORS configuration
  (explicit methods, allowed headers, credentials).
- Removed a stray `console.log` of the database URL from `src/database/data-source.ts`.
- Expanded `.env.example` with previously undocumented variables
  (`NODE_ENV`, `AFRO_SMS_API_KEY`, `AFRO_SMS_API_SECRET`, `CORS_ORIGIN`,
  `LOG_LEVEL`).

### Documentation

- Updated `README.md` to reflect the Apache 2.0 license and upstream attribution.
- Added this `CHANGES.md` file.

## 2026-08-10

### Authorization hardening
- Restricted blog mutations and contact-submission staff access to administrators,
  while retaining public contact form submission and blog reads.
- Restricted reference-data administration to authenticated administrators.
- Scoped contributor dataset deletion to its owner and restricted review decisions
  to assigned, unexpired reviewer work items.
- Enforced project-manager ownership for project operations and task-derived
  management routes, and limited manager reassignment to super-administrators.
- Bound text and audio submissions to microtasks from the requested task and to
  the contributor's assigned work list.
- Updated dataset service test doubles for reviewer-assignment enforcement.

### Authentication hardening
- Rejected inactive accounts during JWT and refresh-token authentication.
- Added rotating, revocable opaque refresh sessions backed by persistent storage.
- Replaced predictable OTPs with CSPRNG-generated, HMAC-protected, single-use
  codes with transactional attempt exhaustion.
- Enabled strict request property whitelisting and replaced self-service profile
  mass assignment with an explicit update allowlist.
- Added fail-closed Redis throttling for authentication, signup, and verification
  endpoints, with explicit trusted-proxy hop configuration.
- Added atomic refresh rotation, password-reset revocation, and cleanup of expired
  or old revoked sessions.
- Added short-lived onboarding-only tokens and revoked active sessions when
  passwords change or accounts are disabled.
### Production containment and infrastructure access
- Disabled test event endpoints and the Bull Board queue administration UI in production.
- Restricted task redistribution to platform administrators.
- Disabled withdrawals by default and introduced configuration validation for the
  withdrawal and payment-provider settings.
- Removed public Docker port mappings for PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, and the
  RabbitMQ management UI; added Redis authentication and non-default RabbitMQ
  credentials for the private application network.
- Added a credential-rotation runbook for local infrastructure and external
  payment, SMS, and email providers.

### Financial integrity
- Added validated withdrawal amounts, atomic wallet reservations, payout state
  tracking, ES256 Santim Pay request signing, and scheduled provider-status
  reconciliation.
- Added migration-level constraints for valid ledger signs, non-negative wallet
  balances, non-negative task payment rates, and unique provider references.
- Prevented task payment-rate changes after task distribution starts.
- Made dataset wallet credits idempotent by locking the dataset row and recording
  contributor/reviewer payment completion in the same transaction as the ledger
  credit.
- Added unit coverage for payout signing and withdrawal reservation validation.

### CI / deployment pipeline
- Replaced placeholder unit-test and lint jobs in `.gitlab-ci.yml` with real
  `npm ci` + `npm run test` / `npm run lint` invocations.
- Fixed the `push_image` job name typo to `push_image`.
- Parameterized the deploy SSH target via `DEPLOY_HOST` / `DEPLOY_USER`
  environment variables instead of a hard-coded IP.
- Added a post-deploy `/api/health` smoke-test job.
- Added full-project typecheck gate to the CI pipeline.
- Pinned npm to v10 in CI workflows and via packageManager.
- Synced npm lockfile with package manifest for CI compatibility.
- Enabled manual triggering of CI workflow with `workflow_dispatch`.
- Fixed CI environment variables and references from Leyu to Mahder.

- Optimized Dockerfile with cache mount for npm installs.

### Branding
- Renamed from Leyu and/or hyperdata to Mahder.

## 2026-08-19 - File upload integration
- Replaced `multer-s3` (incompatible with `@aws-sdk/client-s3` v3) with a custom
  `S3Storage` class that uses `@aws-sdk/lib-storage` `Upload` for multipart-aware
  streaming uploads to MinIO/S3.
- Fixed `forcePathStyle` configuration: the environment string `"true"` was passed
  directly to `S3Client` (expected boolean), causing DNS resolution against virtual-host
  style endpoints (`bucket.minio`) instead of path-style (`minio/bucket`).
- Removed spurious `'error'` event listener on the `Upload` object that fired
  non-fatal streaming warnings, which prematurely rejected the multer callback with
  an `undefined` error.
- Wrapped non-critical side-effects (`emailService.sendEmail`,
  `activityLogService.create`) in `.catch()` handlers inside the project creation
  transactional flow to prevent email failures from aborting the transaction.



## How to record future changes

When making non-trivial modifications, add a short entry under a new dated
section below (or extend an existing category) so downstream users can identify
what diverges from upstream.

## Commit policy

- Before committing implementation changes, record a concise, dated summary in
  this file.
- Split commits by cohesive behavior or deployable concern, and use Conventional
  Commit messages such as `fix(finance): reserve payout funds atomically`.
- Do not include documentation-only files in implementation commits. The sole
  exception is this file, which may be committed separately to record the
  corresponding modifications.
